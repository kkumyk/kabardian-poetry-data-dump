# Kabardian Poetry Data Dump

- the main goal for writing the insert_data.py is to populate the [Kabardian Poetry Collection](https://kabardian-poems-collection-b906b8b63b33.herokuapp.com/) 
- the script extracts poem's data from the poems_contents/poem.txt file, transforms it and loads it to the local database.
- once the data is extracted and confirmed, the contents of the tables will be moved to the corresponding tables in the PostgreSQL database hosted on AWS which the above site is using.
